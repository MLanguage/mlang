# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: '**'
  pull_request:
    branches: '**'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Trigger gitlab mirroring
        env:
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_TOKEN }}
        run: curl --request POST "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23091471/mirror/pull?private_token=$TOKEN" && sleep 30
        # Sleep is hopefully sufficient to wait for gitlab's ci trigger. Otherwise there is a point in the PR where all checks have passed but gitlab's ci hasn't been triggered yet
