(** {1 Translation context}*)

(** {2 Loop translation context} *)

(** The M language has a strange way of doing loops. We translate them by
    unrolling; but for that we need a context to hold the loop parameters, which
    consists of a mapping from characters to integers or other characters. *)

(** The values of the map can be either strings of integers *)

type loop_context = (loop_param_value * int) ParamsMap.t
(** This is the context when iterating a loop : for each loop parameter, we have
    access to the current value of this loop parameter in this iteration. *)

(** Queries a [type: Mir.variable.t] from an [type:idmap] mapping, the name of a

    the variable with the same name and highest rule number that is below the

(** Main translation function from the M AST to the M Variable Graph. This
    function performs 6 linear passes on the input code:

    - [get_constants] gets the value of all constant variables, the values of
      which are needed to compute certain loop bounds;
    - [get_variables_decl] retrieves the declarations of all other variables and
      errors;
    - [get_var_redefinitions] incorporates into [idmap] all definitions inside
      rules along with their execution number;
    - [get_var_data] is the workhorse pass that translates all the expressions
      corresponding to the definitions;
    - [add_dummy_definition_for_variable_declaration] adds [Undefined]
      definitions placeholder for all variables declarations;
    - [get_errors_conds] parses the verification conditions definitions. *)
