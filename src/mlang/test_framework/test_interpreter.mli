    runs the BIR interpreter using float kind [value_sort] and rounding
    operations [round_ops] on a given [test_file]. A margin or error of
    [test_error_margin] is tolerated between the computed values and the
    expected values. [optimize] and [code_coverage] are flags that trigger
    respectively compiler optimizations and code coverage instrumentation for
    the interpreter run. *)
